A lightweight VS Code extension that monitors your Antigravity AI model usage quota and displays it in the status bar.

## Installation (Github)

1. Download the latest `.vsix` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Henrik-3/AntigravityQuota/releases/latest)
2. In VS Code: `Extensions` → `...` → `Install from VSIX...`
3. Restart VS Code / Antigravity

## Installation (Open VSX/Antigravity)

1. Open Antigravity
2. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Antigravity Quota (AGQ)"
4. Click `Install`

## Features

### Real-Time Quota Monitoring

- **Automatic detection** – Finds Antigravity's language server process, port, and auth token without manual setup
- **Background polling** – Periodically fetches quota data to keep the status bar up-to-date
- **Multi-model support** – Tracks quota usage for all available AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.)

### Status Bar Integration

- Displays quota info directly in the VS Code status bar
- Visual indicators:
    - `$(check)` – Quota healthy (>20%)
    - `$(warning)` – Quota low (<20%)
    - `$(error)` – Quota exhausted
- Click to open the interactive quota menu

### Pinned Models

- Pin your favorite models to the status bar for quick visibility
- Toggle pinning from the interactive menu
- When no models are pinned, displays "AGQ" as default

### Interactive Quota Menu

- View all models with progress bars and percentages
- See time until quota reset for each model
- View prompt credits (available/monthly)
- Toggle model visibility directly from the menu

### Cross-Platform Support

- **Windows** – Full support using `wmic` for process detection
- **macOS** – Unix-based detection strategy
- **Linux** – Unix-based detection strategy

## Commands

| Command            | Description                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `AGQ: Refresh Now` | Manually refresh quota data |

## Configuration

Configure via VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`) under **AGQ**:

| Setting               | Default | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `agq.enabled`         | `true`  | Enable/disable quota monitoring             |
| `agq.pollingInterval` | `120`   | Polling interval in seconds (min: 30s)      |
| `agq.pinnedModels`    | `[]`    | Array of model IDs to display in status bar |

## Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Package VSIX
npm run node:vsix:package
```

For Bun users:

```bash
bun run bun:vsix:package
```

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## How It Works

1. **Process Detection** – Scans for Antigravity's language server process and extracts connection parameters
2. **Port Discovery** – Tests listening ports to find the correct API endpoint
3. **Quota Fetching** – Calls `GetUserStatus` API to retrieve model quotas and prompt credits
4. **UI Updates** – Parses the response and updates the status bar with formatted quota info
